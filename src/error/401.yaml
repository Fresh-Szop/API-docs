x-summary: Expired or missing credentials
description: |
    Credentials might be expired, or missing from Cookies (which also can happen,
    if expired Cookie is removed by browser).

    This error can also be produced while trying to check user status in Google API,
    due to communication error, Google Auth token being expired, or user deleting their
    account.
