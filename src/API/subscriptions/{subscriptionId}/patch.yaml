summary: üîê Update subscription
description: |
    Allows to update order details for subscription.
    
    Does not allow alterations to the product list.

    It is important to note, that subscription being active implies that order
    details (address) is filled. Attempting to activate subscription either without it
    having address set prior, or without sending address with activation signal
    (simultaneous updates might not be present on frontend), or event trying to
    remove address without deactivating subscription, will error.
