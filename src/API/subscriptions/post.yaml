summary: 🔐 Create subscription
description: |
    🏗️ **TODO** 👷

    Creates subscription based on current basket contents.

    Created subscription is not filled with order details and is inactive.

    Unlike basket, it does not coerce quantities into available stock and will
    error if requested quantities are not in stock, however unlike order, it does
    not immediately take product from warehouse - subscription will be translated
    to order when its frequency ticks (and can be with subscription activation),
    and only then quantities will be evaluated.
