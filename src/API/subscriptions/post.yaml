summary: üîê Create subscription
description: |
    Creates subscription based on current basket contents.

    Created subscription is not filled with order details and is inactive.

    Unlike basket, it does not coerce quantities into available stock and will
    error if requested quantities are not in stock, however unlike order, it does
    not immediately take product from warehouse - subscription will be translated
    to order when its frequency ticks (subscription must be active), and only
    then quantities will be evaluated.
