        Basket quantity is technically limited to available quantity in stock - if sum
        of current quantity and requested decrease is greater than that, `409` response
        will be given with compromised quantities.

        Requesting decrease larger than or equal to current basket quantity will always
        result in complete removal of product from basket, without producing an error.

            This error indicates that basket is still somewhat valid, but some products
            might have reduced quantity - this usually happens when someone buys some
            quantity of product which is in this basket and full quantity is not available.
